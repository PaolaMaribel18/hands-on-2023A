        "# 16 GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT is a model and approach developed by OpenAI. It is primarily known for its capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text over long passages.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Architecture: GPT is based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike some other models that use both an encoder and a decoder, GPT exclusively utilizes the decoder part of the Transformer for its tasks.\n",
        "* Pre-training and Fine-tuning:\n",
        "    - Pre-training: GPT is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text (like books, articles, websites, etc.). During this phase, it learns to predict the next word in a sentence. This process enables the model to learn grammar, facts about the world, reasoning abilities, and even some level of common sense.\n",
        "    - Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the model can be fine-tuned on a specific task, such as translation, question-answering, or summarization, using a smaller, task-specific dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Autoregressive Nature: GPT generates text in an autoregressive manner. This means it produces one word at a time and uses what it's generated so far as a context to generate the next word.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generative Abilities: As the name suggests, GPT excels at generating text. It can produce text that is often indistinguishable from what a human might write.\n",
        "* Few-Shot Learning: Introduced with GPT-3, this capability allows the model to perform tasks even when provided with very few examples (sometimes as few as one). By just specifying a task in natural language, GPT-3 can often understand and perform the task without explicit fine-tuning.\n",
        "* Versatility: Unlike many models that are trained for a specific task, GPT models, especially GPT-3, are versatile and can handle a wide range of tasks without task-specific training. This includes writing essays, answering questions, creating poetry, generating code, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Versions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* GPT: The original model introduced by OpenAI.\n",
        "\n",
        "* GPT-2: A larger and more powerful version that garnered significant attention due to its impressive text generation capabilities. OpenAI initially withheld the fully-trained model due to concerns about misuse, but later released it given the broader community's responsible usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "* GPT-3: The third iteration with 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest models ever created. It introduced the concept of few-shot and zero-shot learning, further advancing the state-of-the-art in various NLP tasks."
